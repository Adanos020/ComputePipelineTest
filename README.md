# ComputePipelineTest

This is my implementation of a coding exercise I got at a job interview.

The goal was to implement a compute pipeline in C++.

I focused on making the library easy to use and extend with additional actions.


## How to build

The simplest way is to generate build files by executing:
```sh
$ cmake .
```

And then compile:
```sh
$ cmake --build .
```

The build system will produce an executable `ComputePipelineTest` which is an example of how to use the library.
